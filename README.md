# 379 Assignment 3
## A Bankers Algorithm Simulator

This was the final assignment in Cmput 379 at UAlberta.

## Notes:
* Restricted to using one source file
* Should use the *template design pattern* on all of those methods near the bottom that use an identical for loop
* Typical for late-in-semester projects, the code quality suffered
* Please only use as a reference for your own 379 Assignment
